# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline that leads to incorrect results. The issue arises from an oversight in the pipeline's logic, causing unexpected counts or incorrect data ordering in the output.  The bug is more likely to manifest with specific datasets and requires careful review of aggregation stages.

## Bug Description
The provided aggregation pipeline intends to group documents by a specific field, count occurrences, sort by count in descending order, and limit the output to the top 10 results.  Due to an incorrect stage in the pipeline, the result set is not accurate.
